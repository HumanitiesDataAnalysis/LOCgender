Let's do some data analysis about gender.

Steps:

1. State some motivating questions.
2. Pull out the first names.
3. Using the gender package, automatically infer genders.
4. Create summary statistics.
5. Plot this across some form of time.
6. Plot this in soome other ways that *don't* have time as a dimension.
7. Draw some conclusions. Did women leave novels as they found opportunities elsewhere? Are there historical events you can observe?

We'll start with: 2.7 books from the Library of Congress, which should be all the books with personal names in the metadata.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
books = read_csv("~/projects/LOC_gender/authors.csv.gz")
d
```
