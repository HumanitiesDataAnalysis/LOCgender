## Automatically inferring gender.

This can be problematic. Ideally, one could use the LOC's MARC name
authorities, which do contain a
field--[626](http://www.loc.gov/marc/changes-rda-626.html)--that is
supposed to capture the real, attested gender of people, including the
ability to have a person change the name or gender with which they
identify in their life.

But I did a spot check of the official name files, and found that
under 1% of the names in it have genders assigned. Using it adds a lot
of complications, so we'll set that aside for the time being.
